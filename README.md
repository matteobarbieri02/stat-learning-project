The aim of our project was to perform a comprehensive statistical investigation, considering variables that may play a significant role in the arise, development, and management of heart failure. We also identify key factors influencing this condition and provide insights that may improve the understanding and therapeutic approach towards patients with heart failure.
We conducted a clustering analysis to identify patterns within the data. From there, we selected the most significant variables and implemented various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and a few Trees Ensemble methods.
